# Challenge-unit-4-game

## Description

This is an RPG combat mini game where player selects a character, then attacks the other characters.  Health is decreased according to attack power and counter attack power.  If player defeats all other characters without dying, they win.

## Usage

This was an exercise in using jQuery.  It was used specifically to initiate functions on buttons clicks and to move elements on the page.

## Roadmap

At this point, the game does not have functioning Javascript to run properly.  Many corrections will need to be made to the script in order for the game to be playable.
